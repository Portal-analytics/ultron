# Ultron Server

## Architecture

There are two main interfaces into the Ultron services layer: translation service and metadata service.
The Translation service allows clients to open a websocket connection, which allows for the streaming of
audio and text content. The metadata service allows clients to retrieve or delete saved translations, as
well as view other information about the translation.

### Translation Service

Live translation is supported through web sockets using [socket.io][socketio].
Clients must stream audio content as an `m3u` file and plain text will be returned as it is made available by
the backing [speech-to-text service][msft cognitive services].

### Metadata Service

Specific translation information is available via a REST API. Documentation for the API is available [here][swagger].
